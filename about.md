### TLDR;


Hi i'm Paul, Machine Learning Engineer, StarAi project lead & founder of the Sydney Machine Learning group.

My current focus is on applying Deep Learning to Building Strata metering data to detect existing building services.

Outside of this I actively performing research in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning for the StarAi project &
 am the lead organizer of the Sydney Machine Learning group, the largest community of machine learning practitioners in
 Sydney, Australia.

This page contains a brief summary of all of my work in the field of Machine Learning since I got started back in 2009.
If you would like to know more- read on:

## In reverse chronological order:

### 2009

I first got started in Machine Learning by being thrown into the "Deep" end with my honours thesis project during my
Electrical Engineering Degree. For this project I used an [Echo State Network (ESN)](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Echo_state_network), a type of Neural Network, to
perform control of a virtual agent.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are incredibly expensive to train via algorithms such as Backpropagation Through Time
(BTT)
.

Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a form of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) developed to address the incredible
 "training" difficulty of vanilla RNNs- by having a fixed "reservoir" of randomly connected layers of virtual neurons, and
  a final "trainable" layer that connects to the "reservoir". Echo State Networks fall under the research branch of
  "Liquid State Machines", a genre of

The goal of the agent was to navigate to a
random point in 2D space. Once it reached the goal, the point was reser
