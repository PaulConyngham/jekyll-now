Hi i'm Paul, Machine Learning Engineer, StarAi project lead & founder of the Sydney Machine Learning group.

My current focus is on applying Deep Learning to building Strata apartment blocks metering data to detect existing
building services.

Outside of this I actively performing research in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning for the StarAi project &
 am the lead organizer of the Sydney Machine Learning group, the largest community of machine learning practitioners in
 Sydney, Australia.

This page contains a brief summary of my work in the field of Machine Learning since I got started back in 2009.

I first got started in Machine Learning by being thrown into the "Deep" end with my honours thesis project for my
Electrical Engineering Degree. For this project I used an [Echo State Network (ESN)](http://www.scholarpedia
.org/article/Echo_state_network), a type of Neural Network (Deep Learning for the uninitiated), to
perform control of a virtual agent.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are incredibly expensive to train via algorithms such as Backpropagation Through Time
(BTT)
.

Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a form of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) developed to address the incredible
 "training" difficulty of vanilla RNNs- by having a fixed "reservoir" of randomly connected layers of virtual neurons, and
  a final "trainable" layer that connects to the "reservoir". Echo State Networks fall under the research branch of
  "Liquid State Machines", a genre of Neural network that is known within research communities to closely match the
  functionality of real neural networks of the human brain.

The goal of this research project was to have an autonomous "agent" navigate to a random point in 2D space. Once it
reached the goal, the point was reset and the agent would have to start over- Demonstrating that
